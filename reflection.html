    <h1>Reflection of homework</h1>
    <p>
      This homework took me back to when I first started learning programming. I
      first started learning programming through HTML and CSS, back when I was
      first experimenting with programming, seeing if this is something I would
      like. It turns out, I extremely love programming. I enjoy the challenge it
      gives me, allowing me to be creative, and knowing there's multiple ways of
      completing one solution. I like being able to create something and see my
      creation come to life, and be of service to someone else. This project
      brought me back to the Front-End world, from when I first started banging
      my head on my laptop, trying to figure out why my code wasn't working. I'm
      glad I was able to complete this project, and I'm looking forward to the
      next one.
    </p>

      Let me first start off saying, I absolutely dislike working with CSS
      frameworks, haha. When I first started learning HTML and CSS, I told
      myself I would learn CSS to a point to where I would not have to rely on a
      framework to do what I needed to do. I remember I really took my time
      learning CSS, including Flexbox and Grid. It took me 5 months total to
      feel comfortable with my CSS skills and being able to say I can implement
      vanilla CSS with relatively no problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that being said, this project still hasn't changed my mind about
      frameworks, haha. I'm still not a fan of using them, just because of the
      level of control they restrict the programmer from using, at least from a
      CSS standpoint (I've used ReactJS and I do enjoy how easy it allows you to
      implement JavaScript).
    </p>
    <p>
      There weren't many hangups I experienced while building this project. The
      only hangup I had was keeping the footer at the bottom of the page.
      Normally, I would start a HTML/CSS project from a mobile-first aspect, but
      since I haven't built anything with HTML/CSS for a long time, I totally
      forgot about that method. So to overcome that hangup, I set the body's
      display property to display: flex, the flex-direction property to
      flex-direction: column, and the min-height to 100vh. Then on the main
      section of the body, I set a flex-grow to 1. This allowed me to keep the
      footer at the bottom of the page for each of the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a good refresher to HTML/CSS. I look forward to the next project
      where we'll be using JavaScript.
